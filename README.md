# NASAPhotoApp
NASA Picture of the day app

This simple app is an exercise on the integration of an API - api.nasa.gov
The app is built programmatically, includes some UI refinement over and above what was demanded from the exercise.

The views are embedded in a scrollView so the description can be accessed even if the systemFont size is large.
The spinner (UIActivityIndicatorView) was added as well so it doesn't look like the app is frozen at the beginning when fetching from the API.


Exercise source: Develop in Swift (Volume 3) - Data Collections - Apple
